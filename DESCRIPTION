Description: A high-level wrapper that simplifies text classification into three streamlined steps: preprocessing, 
      model training, and prediction. 
    It unifies the interface for multiple algorithms (including 'glmnet', 
    'ranger', and 'xgboost') and vectorization methods (Bag-of-Words, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)), 
    allowing users to go from raw text to a trained sentiment model in two function 
    calls. The resulting model artifact automatically handles preprocessing for 
    new datasets in the third step, ensuring consistent prediction pipelines.
