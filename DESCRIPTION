Description: Provides a complete and modular pipeline for text classification. 
    Includes functions for text preprocessing, multiple vectorization methods 
    (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF), and a suite of high-performance machine learning models 
    (e.g., glmnet, ranger, xgboost). Designed to be easily extensible for 
    comparing different modeling approaches.
