#' Train a Random Forest Model using Ranger
#'
#' This function trains a Random Forest model using the high-performance ranger
#' package. It handles the necessary conversion from a sparse DFM to a dense
#' matrix and corrects for column name inconsistencies.
#'
#' @param train_vectorized The training feature matrix (e.g., a `dfm` from quanteda).
#' @param Y The response variable for the training set. Should be a factor.
#' @param test_vectorized The test feature matrix, which must have the same
#'   features as `train_vectorized`.
#'
#' @return A list containing two elements:
#'   \item{pred}{A vector of class predictions for the test set.}
#'   \item{model}{The final, trained `ranger` model object.}
#'
#' @importFrom ranger ranger
#' @importFrom stats predict
